# Learn hard skills, especially if you don't want to

Armageddon is a 1998 film in which a group of oil rig worker are trained to be astronauts so that they can go and fix a Space Problem of some kind, possibly an asteroid on a collision course with earth, possibly the sun is about to blow up or go out or something. Look I haven't actually seen the film and I'm not going to look it up because the details are not relevant to the point of this post (in fact they would probably take away from the profound generality of what I'm about to say). The reason I've heard of it is because people say "hurr durr wouldn't it be easier to train astronauts to be oil workers than to train oil workers to be astronauts?".

Well would it? It would probably take fewer hours of training for an astronaut to get to the bare minimum level of competence required in oil drilling, but this is no guarantee that they would end up any better at the job they had to do. In fact if I watched the film I'm sure I would find that the can-do spirit and working class gumption of the oil workers proved vital for a task that the stuffy rule following nerds at NASA wouldn't have had the guts to do.

In real life however the concrete lure of lower upfront costs usually beats the abstract and unknowable spectre of potential. The people who end up with the minimum skills necessary to do the hardest jobs are people who almost had those skills already. You need to know the law to be a politician, so most politicians used to be lawyers. The most general statement of this is idea is as follows:

> If HARDER_SKILL + SOFTER_SKILL are required as a minimum for TASK, it takes less effort for someone who already has HARDER_SKILL to learn SOFTER_SKILL than the other way round. As a result we observe that individuals who already had HARDER_SKILL are overrepresented among people doing TASK.

This has some obvious (negative) side effects:
<ul>
    <li>All politicians being lawyers is obviously bad.</li>
    <li>There are way too many "learn-to-code" platforms because building an online platform requires the softer skill of 'coming up with ideas for websites' and the harder skill of 'knowing how to code'. And for some reason by the time people learn how to code they think it is the most important thing in the universe.</li>
    <li>Plenty of novels feature a shy, unassuming young protagonist who escapes to a fantasy world. Because the people who end up good at writing were shy and unassuming children who spent their childhoods escaping to fantasy worlds.</li>
</ul>

 The upside of this however is that if you want to do something that requires a difficult skill that a) you don't have and b) will put a lot of people off, you are more likely to end up excelling at that thing than most people who attempt it. You are more likely to do something truly novel because your competition will be more similar to each other than they are to you. So hop off that oil rig and shoot for the stars, baby!
