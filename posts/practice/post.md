[This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/reasonisfun/status/1275885898421407745) got me thinking about practice. A lot of praise is heaped on practice. It's a very convenient explanation for how people get Good at stuff because it makes the person who is Good feel virtuous, it downplays the role of natural ability, and it is aspirational for the person who is Bad.

If you are deeply cynical like I am this should set off some alarm bells, all else equal a more convenient explanation is more likely to be overrated than a less convenient one<sup>1</sup>. Of course all else is not equal in this case because thinking for 5 seconds about how brains must have evolved to work will tell you that ~all else equal~ practicing something should make you better at it.

Other ways of getting better at something I am going to generically refer to as "theory", these include reading books about it, watching other people do it, thinking about it, overcoming anxiety about it, getting better at a related thing in the hope that the skills will transfer. These tend to be more amorphous, with no guaranteed payoff, or indeed with no payoff at all. You can read a book about playing the guitar and not get any better, maybe it's a bad book, maybe you read it wrong.

So far reasoning about this hasn't gotten us much further than "practice is probably good on average but probably overrated on average", perhaps some examples from my own life (kind of) will help to work out when just straight practicing is and isn't a good strategy.

### Examples
<ul>
    <li>
        Maths: maths is an area in which I have found practice to be overrated. In school the teacher would "explain something" and then you would have to do exercises on it, loads of exercises, on some very specific thing (like factoring a quadratic). I always thought this was stupid because if you understand something it only takes a couple of exercises to "confirm your understanding", or discover you've misunderstood it and correct. If you don't understand something doing exercises is either going to result in you getting them wrong, or memorising some method as a substitute for understanding. It is worth noting that I was "naturally" quite good at maths as a kid.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rowing (technique): Firstly rowing is surprisingly hard, it's still not that hard but it looks like it should be easy, a big part of this is because the boat wants to capsize. Learning all the "theoretical" advice about how to row and how to balance the boat could probably take about an hour. Practicing this until it wasn't a limiting factor took me about 50-100 hours. After that point you are mostly limited by strength and improving technique doesn't make much difference.
    </li>
    <li>
        Driving: This is not really from my own life as such, I just wanted to make the point that driving is one of few skills which satisfies the following conditions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The label "skill" applies in a non-slippery way<sup>2</sup>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most (or almost most) people have something like the magic ~10,000 hours~ of experience
            </li>
            <li>
                Most people stop getting better at a point that is no way near what you would call "mastery"
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Writing: For the other three I have already "gotten good", so I can look back and reason about how that happened. I would like to get better at writing but I don't have a good intuition for what the best way to do that is, some generic strategies might be
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read (critically, whatever that means) works by people whose style I would like to emulate
            </li>
            <li>
                Just write, write, write, publish, publish, publish, gotta hit 10,000 hours baby
            </li>
            <li>
                Read "theory" about what makes good writing and follow it
            </li>
        </ul>
        Maybe these are all good strategies, maybe one is 10x better than the others, I don't really have any strong intuitions about them.
    </li>
</ul>

From these examples we can guess at some heuristics:
<ul>
    <li>
        (from maths, driving) Practicing can be *worse* than theory, because you can practice errors, or you can bypass the theory by learning something by rote (which can limit how good you can get, can make it harder to learn related stuff in future, or at minimum will be slower)
    </li>
    <li>
        (from maths) Being naturally good at something will make practice appear overrated to you because advice about how much to practice will be targeted at the average person.
    </li>
    <li>
        (from rowing, driving kind of) Practice is probably not overrated for most physical stuff (rowing, and probably most sport, dancing, etc), because it is harder to theorise about it. More broadly you might expect that any skill that is hard to describe in writing will benefit most from just doing it.
    </li>
    <li>
        (from driving) In order to get better you need to be practicing stuff close to the limit of your ability, this is why people don't get better at driving just by driving a lot.
    </li>
    <li>
        (from maths, rowing) There is a difference between discrete abilities (like long division), where you can either do the thing or you can't, and continuous abilities (like rowing), where you can better or worse at the thing. For the former practice is of limited use<sup>3</sup> once you achieve basic competence, for the latter practice continues to be useful.
    </li>
</ul>
None of this really helps with my writing strategy, ah well.

### Footnotes
- <sup>(1) This line of reasoning sometimes leads temperamentally contrarian people (like myself) to instinctively assume edgy explanations are right and wholesome explanations are wrong. This is often an overcorrection, sometimes wholesome explanations are just correct</sup>
- <sup>(2) An example of skills where the word applies in a slippery way are "social skills" or "critical thinking". One hint that something is a well-behaved "skill" is that you can measure how good someone is at it (for driving this could be speed round a track, or number of accidents over driver's lifetime)</sup>
- <sup>(3) You can reduce the frequency of errors I suppose</sup>
